Originally built in 1897 as a hotel during the gold rush period of Western Australia's history, it was converted to banking chambers and offices in the 1980s and now accommodates offices and banking chambers of the Bank of Western Australia Ltd. (BankWest). The building is located on the most prominent intersection in the financial district of the city, at the corner of St Georges Terrace and William Street and sits in the shadow of one of the tallest buildings in Perth, the 204 metres (669 ft) BankWest Tower. When the hotel opened for business on 18 March 1897 it was, although slightly smaller than some of its contemporary buildings in other capital cities in Australasia, described as ""... one of the most beautiful and elegant hotels in Australasia"". Other praise included: ""... redolent of the bourgeois luxury and splendour of the Paris of Napoleon III"" and later ""... in its day, as sumptuous a hostelry as any in Melbourne or Sydney."" It operated as licensed premises from 1897 until 1981.",,,
